subtitle: "A nightmare distopia pairing the best of Orwell & Huxley."
---

As anybody who has ever spoken to me will know, I hold the writing of authors Aldous Huxley and George Orwell in very high regard. Equilibrium, while it didn't perform well in the Box Office, was thoroughly enjoyable and did a fantastic job of mixing together elements from two of the greatest dystopian novels ever written: Brave New World, and 1984.

**Spoiler alert.** I will be discussing the themes of this film in-depth and sparing no plot details past this point.

The film touched me personally, as it is heavily centered around the themes of repressing one's own humanity, and sacrificing the turmoil and chaos of a full life for one of safety, conformity and regularity.

# The World

The protagonist of the film is John Preston, who works as a Cleric for the city-state of Libra. Clerics are elite operators responsible for enforcing the rules and regulations of the regime with *Gunkata*... Think the matrix.

John Preston's society was formed from the ashes of the third world war, a nuclear holocaust. The society is built upon the chemical repression of emotions through the drug *Equilibrium.* Citizens of Libra take timed doses of Equilibrium throughout the working week; as far as I could tell, twice a day.
