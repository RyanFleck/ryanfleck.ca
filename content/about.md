Hello! My name is **Ryan**, and I am a passionate computer programmer. Currently I
attend the _University of Ottawa_ pursuing a BASc in Computer Engineering.
Alongside internships at _IBM_ and _MNP LLP_, I contribute to _Xalgorithms
Foundation_ projects and the _UOE Racing Team_.

This [minimalist](/2019/digital-minimalism/) website stores my
long-form writing; records of experiments, musings, tutorials, and articles on
technology.

I also store a collection of personal notes at **[manuals.ryanfleck.ca](https://manuals.ryanfleck.ca)**, my other less formal referential website.

I'm always looking for new, innovative projects to contribute to.

My email inbox,
**[hello@ryanfleck.ca,](mailto:hello@ryanfleck.ca)**
is the most reliable way to get in touch.
I check this inbox twice a day. At those times, I will read all of the messages
and pencil in a future time to respond to the most important. At one point, I
monitored LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook for Business, Slack and a medley of
other messengers; this proved to be a touch overwhelming. I prefer to work in
large, uninterrupted blocks of time.

Please visit my [Github](https://github.com/ryanfleck/),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-c-fleck/), or [old tech blog](https://ryanfleck.github.io) for more info.
