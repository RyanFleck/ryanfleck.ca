For the past 4 months this is how I've spent roughly 95% of my time.

Just chilling, sitting here doing... God knows what, programming?

Right now I'm working on a C++ Program assignment and it's been fun... But let me tell you the story of the best advice I ever received, and it wasn't from a person it was surprisingly enough it was just from a TV show and not even an adult TV show, a cartoon.

Any advice for stress and let's see if you can guess where it came from.

**Sucking at something is the first step to being really good at something.**

Now. That's Jake the dog from Adventure Time finally enough but it's it's true the advice Rings true.

Sucking at something is the first step to being very good at something and... That simple idea has carried me through so many things it's a humbling idea it's a invigorating idea. It means that, you know, through hard work and determination and grass you can essentially be whoever you want to be, and that's why I call this wery innocent phrase so very much and that phrase one more time is sucking at something is the first step to being good at something.

So sharp. Short video I know but. I got work to do. Can't blame me.
