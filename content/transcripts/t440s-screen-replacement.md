This is going to be a short tutorial on how to replace the display in your t440s I ordered this new panel from laptopscreen.com and it just came in the mail today so let's cracker open I know that the first thing we need to do and I'm pretty sure we don't need to undo the whole chassis to replace the screen is take a knife. I'm very very carefully because this entire bottle is actually a sticker so you into very very carefully, and our liedjes needs need to slip the knife very gently underneath. That sticker corner, and then you can start pulling sticker app.

Image gently work. The sticker loose because we obviously need to reuse that sticker. If we want our laptop to remain pretty.

As you can see. Substitute about halfway off now you want to be careful not to touch the back side of the sticker because. Then I won't be able to if your back onto this display after. All right after the battle has been. Take it off you can just set this entire sticker things aside and make sure it stays adhesive signed up and away from Dusty objects. The next thing we're going to do is take care of all of these little screws. Fiskars share the screen to the frame and we need to remove them to remove the screen. So after the four silver quarter screws have been removed from here. You can simply snap away this front bezel just by putting your. Now in between the bezel and... The well. Rapper this whole system so you need to use either a guitar pick or a nail to separate those two halves. As soon as my camera focuses I'll just a separate a little bit more of this. You can just cut gently very gently and yellow carrots and snaps, and that is the sound of the elastic coming undone. Fragment that done you can simply lift the pedal forward and out. So you have this. Plastic Square thing and you can put that somewhere else, and this is what we're left with this is probably the most important step. At the bottom edge here behind the display there's a ribbon cable that connects play right about here and see our new panel.

This is picking at you that we're looking for. On this day is going to be roughly.

So we need to do is we need to gently allow this panel to fall forward. Inability to find it. Ensuring that we don't. Take that ribbon cable or mess with it anyway, and then very carefully we need to disconnect.. So what you're going to need to do that you would need to take your knife and you're going to think need to make a tiny cut in the tape without touching the circuit board. Here. You're here just. Around the component on the clear part of the tape and then you'll be able to gently pull back, and Wallah your connector is free. I just. Gently placed my new display down on top of my keyboard the 30-pin cable is up here ready to be connected to the new display after we do that we should be able to flip this display. Back up into the chassis to hear the first cruise of the corners but the old padlock cover and sticker back on and we'll be good to go. As this is a relatively delicate procedure I'm going to connect this with the camera down. Just like that we're connected. So I've put display back up into the chassis let's just confirm that everything works. Before we start resembling everything.

Well. What's good to me. Do that's funny I hope that's part the secret not part of the display itself it looks like it is part of the sticker. I will just wait for the boot process to finish and make sure. Yeah it was like my operating system can use to display properly. Sleep well that's not I'll start putting everything back together. Richest place that little metal piece. Going to display and we just pressed gently along the edges to snap. Everything back into place. The next we Trail all the corner screws back in and last step is the sticker.

Feels good.. Wow and just like that you've got a brand new. Fantastic 1080p display in your ThinkPad t440s. So like comment and subscribe if you like the repair video I'm happy to report after filling with these display for a little bit see me my camera will focus on it properly and contrast levels are great and very happy with it and I can't see any dead pixels are missed coloured pixels, and I would buy again. Also shut out to Lenovo for continuing to make repairable thinkpads this is a t440s so it's a little dated but please keep making them this easy to repair it because it's lovely.
