If you are a first or second-year student looking to learn a few Technologies to land an internship you should be looking at web-dev and simple back ends.

Cheers, it's been a long day.

I'm recording this video because I wanted to share an anecdote with you guys.

Today I was having a conversation with a young colleague and... This colleague was trying to recruit me to become a webmaster at a different School Organization, and I eventually said yes because that kind of thing is fun and webmaster is basically just a fancy word for let's go build a website but our conversation eventually pivoted to internships how to get them what's in the van right now and how I got mine and what I've done.

...and we start talking and I'm talking about have been my experience that he says yeah I am currently trying to learn Java and hopefully if I learn Java I'll be able to get some good internships and I said. No. Probably not and this is why. Companies that are looking for Java developers are current are probably looking for. Experienced Java developers all of the Java development positions and internships that I have seen or been involved in have required. Those people have an internship or two under their belts first and have a very good understanding of object-oriented programming. If you are just getting into your first internship job I may not be the best choice for you to to learn to try to get an internship simply because a lot of the jobs that require Java will also require you to know about about databases or you know Java EE and all that weirdness nuances of that and about Enterprises programming in general and that's just not something that most students have the time or wherewithal to go about researching. Or learning on their own. I thought to this. Like I said you should learn JavaScript. Quick side note. My current internship with wise assistant that is turned into a part-time job while I've been taking school this semester I got that position on a side called Angel list and AngelList has. Well in fact is a side Focus exclusively on connecting startups with young professionals and if you take a stroll through AngelList. You're not going to see a ton of java you will primarily be seeing reactive Oliver's wanted and python developers wanted and that's because if you are not a huge and a huge or eaten medium sized Enterprise you are probably going to be building your applications or if your startup you will definitely build building your new application with a front-end of react JS and a back-end of either. Django which is a python framework hour or nodejs and a bunch of microservices if the requirements for the back-end are a little lighter, and knowing this I told him. You probably should not focus on job app for the first. The first little while that you're learning with the goal of trying to get an internship. Knowing that you need a little more experience with Javed actually land something, and knowing that you need a lot less experience with. With Django and flask and react and python or sorry. Yeah JavaScript and react on the frontend. Flask and Django which are both python libraries on the backend with that combination Technologies you can build a lot of really robust will apps and it's scalable. The startup I work at Weis assistant currently uses Django on the backend and react in the front end and depart from. Real-time things. Django is the number one choice for startups primarily because it's so easy to work with. With Django you can essentially use even starting from scratch is easy but there's this thing called cookie-cutter Django and with that you have bundled users authentication a simple front end that's already ready to go and a Docker container that allow you to spend up a local development environment and really easily deployed to somewhere like Roku or any cloud provider. So all that being said and I know that was a whole there was a whole lot of gibberish, and so I'm sorry if you didn't understand a lot of those words you do have the Google machine I told this kid you should go and... You should go and Learn Python and react. Because with those two things you can very quickly right. Basically an end-to-end Enterprise application that. If you can prove that you know how that little application works you will impress you will impress the companies that are trying to hire you and you will be hired, and that's exactly how I got hired at Weis assistant I'm basically replicated their text back I put together a Django app connected to a react app, and they said all right good job kid clearly you can use all the stuff that were using clearly you have the initiative to go ahead and...

Well he'll do a lot of work to try and impress us to get on the team. You're hired. So option eight obviously from that story is be able to replicate the company's text back that's obviously not always possible. Thai take-away be should be it's a really easy to quickly build an impressive react + Django app in a very short amount of time, and this is why I start a piece of technology it's easy to get up and running once scale becomes a real concern companies as far as I've seen will often switch to. To Java funnily enough, but only once they've grown. I think I said all the way up. I went to same so really his thumb up. If you are a first or second-year student looking to learn a few Technologies to land an internship you should be looking at Webb death and simple. Guns and currently the best Technologies for web dev and simple. Cans are Django and react. That's all for tonight thanks for watching like share and subscribe while I'm a real YouTuber, and have a nice evening.
