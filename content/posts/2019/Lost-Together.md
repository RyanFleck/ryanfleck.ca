I grew up in Calgary, Alberta with a group of friends that was, in retrospect,
quite a mixed bag. Looking back and trying to figure out what kept us together,
I'm sure our deep friendships have more to do with our common pain than common
interests. Most of our time spent together was eating, talking, and drinking.

On many days we would all get together in one basement or another, play video
games, watch films, drink, pass out late on a floor or couch, go home, clean
up, and repeat. These distractions we shared were occasionally visited by
conversations of what was next, what was going on in our lives, but more often
than not, we simply discussed shit. It was a big distraction. What could we do
to take charge of our lives and move ahead? It was all we could do; keep
distracted, and stave off the anxiety and chaos of tomorrow for a short while.

We were all lost souls, dealing with life as best as we could, and we took
comfort in the fact that we were all lost together.

I knew it wasn't healthy. But it helped. Like a drug.

...

Weaker members of the group would regularly talk quite openly about their
problems at home. I did this while feeling guilty, knowing that others in the
group, with problems which were catastrophic or far worse, were putting on a
stiff upper lip.

Our culture today attempts to portray the sharing of deep, troubling thoughts
and the tumultuous worries of life as strong and courageous. I still haven't
decided if I believe this. At a deep level, I am convinced that sharing too much
is simply emotionally greedy, even to this day when friends are willing to
listen.

...

Time passed, and a few of us headed out to University. We all floundered. At
Westmount, though we were encouraged, there was no need to develop healthy study
habits. We were all possessed with a deep apathy, enabled by intelligence enough
to breeze through classes, and this void of values resulted in dismal failure.
I was able to recover, as an entity came into my life that picked me up and
shone a light forward. I was the lucky member of our friend group. Nobody else,
so far, has come close to completing a degree or attaining a useful education.

Only one member of our friend group has found the beginnings of a career, and
from what I can tell, he hates it, seeing the greener grass on the other side of
the working pasture. While he longs to work as a white collar, he doesn't know
that this part of the working world has its fair share of downsides as well.
