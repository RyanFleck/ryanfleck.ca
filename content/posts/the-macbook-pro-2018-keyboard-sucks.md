As an intern at IBM, I was assigned what most people would consider to be an incredibly high-quality machine: A 2018, 15-Inch MacBook Pro with 16 Gigs of DDR4 and *the touchbar.* To buy this thing new, for myself, It'd cost me over $3500 of the near-worthless cash we Canadians call Dollars. Certainly a pricey machine, and it isn't for naught: The screen is excellent. I'm sure that people have suffered for screens like this; surreal clarity, even lighting, vivid colors, a pixel density that'll let you set the text so small you can read it with a microscope. The screen is fantastic. The build quality and materials are undeniably excellent.

Everything else about the machine, from the engineering of the keyboard and the trackpad, to sacrificing battery life for a thin chassis, the gimmicky (though fun) touchbar, is detrimental to the user experience. It is undeniable that almost every aspect of this machine is a marvel of modern engineering, but without the vision of a competent developer machine behind each hardware iteration... It is easy to conclude that Apple no longer designs computers for pros.

The keyboard and trackpad, which I made my best effort to begin using with the open-est of minds, and enjoyed for the first few months, is on the verge of giving me a serious case of carpal tunnel syndrome. The force-touch trackpad, which requires a different delta in force to actuate, will hurt your wrists. All in all, I can guarantee Apple's hot new digs will be murder on your fingers and wrists.

To add insult to literal injury, the keyboard feels nice to type on at low speeds, but will often not completely actuate at high speeds; after my fingers decide feedback has been given, they will move away, but lo, No letter appears on the screen.
