title: "Xalgo Elevator Pitch"
subtitle: ""
draft: true

I've been lucky to have participated in the Xalgorithms project for over a year now. While I haven't contributed anything while working at IBM, I figured I should solidify something of an elevator pitch so I could explain the project, and my involvement in it, to others when I need.

Here goes:

<br />

I contribute to an open-source project called Xalgorithms. At a high level, the project is about improving global trade and finance by clarifying when and how rules apply to a transaction.

For example, imagine a guy named Trevor. Trevor has grown his small business selling niche products from Ontario, and has been able to expand to other provinces by himself. Unfortunately, he has reached all of this customers in Canada. Luckily, there's a demand in other countries.

At this point, to deal with import, export, and international regulations, Trevor faces a problem. It's too difficult for him to manage his business and do this alone. He has a few options:

1. Use a third-party distributor which will take a large cut of his profits.
2. Hire a legal team to sort everything out. 
3. Send his transaction, and all the surrounding context, through XA to see what trade and tax rules will apply.

...

At this point, my understanding of the project goals break down a bit.
