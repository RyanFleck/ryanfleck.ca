Though it does not reflect the current build, you can download the last stable BCOM concept here: **[BattleCommander.jar](https://github.com/RyanFleck/BattleCommander/releases)**

_Sigh_.

I ran into some trouble that I couldn't solve. So, instead of trying to restructure my code to accomodate a new _extends_, I've decided to scrap my work and restart from square one.

Scene2D seems like a very logical next step, as it will make the creation/implementation of unit heirarchies, hit detection, and input much easier.

**Q:** "_But Ryan, your units already extend ACTOR, part of Scene2D!_"

**A:** Yes, they do. But I implemented a lot of things that didn't need to be there had I known about Scene2D. I still get to keep all my art assets, so rebuilding from the ground up seems like a better plan.

## The current state of BCOM:

...after half an hour of new development. Still gotta instantiate my _Tiled_ map.
