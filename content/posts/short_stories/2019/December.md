# No Problems Whatsoever

<br />

It began slowly.

Ever so slowly.

Here and there, rain would trickle through a gap in the mouldering pine shakes
and Frederick would hear a *tat* as a drop noiselessly slipped from a crack in
the ceiling and landed resonantly on the floorboards.

Turning with indifference, Frederick would coldly search the floorboards for the
culprit and, on identifying the drop of water, trace upwards to the ceiling
where the drop fell. He was getting tired of living in the old house he had
rented from a hag, who had promised the place had no problems whatsoever,
failing to mention the pests, leaks, heating problems and lack of property
maintenance staff.

He recalled the first time a droplet had fallen. It had been during a downpour;
the first gentle *tap* had turned into a dribbling *hiss* as a small waterfall 
materialized in the ceiling of his apartment.

Now, as he sat staring at his ceiling, he could only raise an eyebrow at the new
leak, as if to pleasantly greet a disliked colleague.

Turning back to his work, Frederick made a mental note to himself, scribbling
that he hated those like his greedy, lying land-lady, placing it on a pile with
many others, a heap of kindling that would only grow dry with the falling of
rain.

# June and the Ghost 

<br />

She held him like it was the last time she would ever see his stupid,
beautiful face; burying her head in his neck and breathing the smells of
sweat and pine. His strong arms gently, but firmly, were placed around her
waist and back, drawing her further into the embrace. She could feel the heat
of his body through her winter coat. The world grew dark around her as she
melted into him, like warm syrup over pancakes, like cream into coffee, like
the darkest of chocolates and the finest wine. Her soul was afloat on rivers
of milk and honey.

As she lay awake one night, she yearned to burn again, like she had that day
in fall.

The ceiling, dimly illuminated by the moonlight flowing through the open
balcony doors, stared back at her with apathy. A breeze blew across her body,
half covered by soft white linen, cool and pleasant in the humid warmth of
the summer night. Why was John so distant, she wondered, thinking back to all
the times when he had been so sweet and loving. Perhaps there was someone
else. Perhaps he wasn't interested in her any longer. Perhaps he had never
been interested in her.

She turned to touch his sleeping form, but he was a specter that she would
never truly touch.

# The Gamble

<br />

I inhaled another ragged, mildly smoky breath through the tube extending above
the surface of the water. At least I had goggles and could see. Above me,
extending further than I could swim in all directions, was an oil slick fire.
The surface of the shimmering ocean above me was ablaze. I was stuck beneath it,
breathing from a storm drain of a small floating buoy. A beach was probably 50
meters away from me, but I was certain the beach would be just as dangerous, and
aflame, as the water itself.

It had probably been thirty minutes since the fire started. I could see the
bodies of my fellow crewmen floating at the surface, burning along with the
crude. They had not been so lucky as I. Still, I would have to surface
eventually.

It was becoming difficult to breathe. It took some effort to pull air through
the long tube, and I was beginning to feel light-headed from smoke inhalation.
My options weren't great. I dove down a few meters in an attempt to find a place
to surface; still nothing. Back to the pipe to take a breath.

I could do one of three things. Option one: Take as much air in me as I could,
swim as far out to sea as I could, and hope for the best. Option two: Swim to
the beach, run up, and attempt to roll the fire out on land, assuming there was
good, dry land up there that wasn't currently ablaze.

Option three was to wait until the fire went out. It shouldn't take too long.
After all, how much time could it possibly take for all the crude to pour out of
a tanker and burn?

*four hours later*

I was comfortable under the water. The fiery and inky-black patterns of burning
crude flowing across the surface lit the sea floor with a lively orange hue now
that the sun had set. I would surely die of lung cancer in a few years, with the
volume of smoke that I had inhaled, but the small...


**Uh oh.** this scenario doesn't make any sense. The amount of dead,
oxygen-deprived air between the diver's mouth and the end of the tube would be
larger than the volume of air the diver could inhale. Though the diver could
never _exhale_ through the tube.

...no, wait, he could just inhale and block the tube with his thumb.
