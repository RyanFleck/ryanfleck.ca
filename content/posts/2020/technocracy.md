* Conclusions

The Technocratic political movement emerged in the 1930s as Scientists and
Engineers proposed a better and brighter way forward, paved by the relentless
application of the scientific method to the problems of modern society.
Horrified by the first Great War of 1914-1918, and confronted with the Great
Depression from 1929-1939, technologists proposed a bureaucracy with members
selected based on merit and specialized knowledge, and not necessarily by
election. By treating all of society's social and technical issues as
engineering problems, the most fair and efficient solutions could be produced,
and the top-heavy and slow legislative process could be deprecated.

A monad, representing the balance between production and consumption, was used
by Howard Scott as the logo for Technocracy Inc. Interestingly, the monad is 
also associated with many philosophical and religious beliefs, particularly 
_gnosticism_.

Interestingly, Canada banned Technocracy in 1940, allegedly due to opposition to
the Second World War. An archive of Technocracy material from this era is stored
at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.

As of late, rather than the purely analytical reasoning of technology seeping
into the convoluted and biased world of politics and social sciences, the
doublethink of these domains has been seeping backwards into computing.

The realm of computers is currently a very secular one, albeit tainted at the
fringes with brain-bending notions of equal understanding, co-operation, and
productivity no matter how little the people present know about the subject
matter, or comprehension of the subtleties of the project's goals.

If everybody has an equal capacity for applying logic and holding complex data
structures in their heads, then it is entirely fair to assert that hard work is
the answer, and that anybody can be a successful computer programmer.

However, this is blatantly false, as evidenced by observations as simple as
brain volume, or as universal as the g factor of intelligence. Expecting every
person on this earth to be able to perform equally mentally is akin to expecting
a paraplegic child in a wheelchair to be able to run with his classmates.

All of the best programmers that I know, while potentially having fringe
political opinions, will co-operate happily with just about everybody under the
sun as long as they share the core programmers' motivation of making magic
within the machine. I personally have a great antipathy for any sort of moral
posturing that positions groups of people as greater or lesser out on the field.
The only thing that should matter when programming is the collective
accomplishment of the goals of the project.

One of my colleagues has a particularly interesting Twitter account, with views
that, if we were to speak about them, I would vehemently disagree with, and
attempt to persuade him otherwise. Hell, that's politics. His work and feedback
on my work are so useful that I dare not disrupt our excellent working
relationship by doing this.

While I cannot claim to be any sort of philosopher or politician, I can speak
from my view as a Computer Engineer, and generally as someone who regularly
deals with the art and science of computers and digital logic.

While programming, we must keep God's moral principles in our hearts, or we risk
losing our humanity to daemons of our own creation.
