title: "Technocracy"
draft: true

While I cannot claim to be any sort of philosopher or politician, I can speak
from my view as a Computer Engineer, and generally as someone who regularly
deals with the art and science of computers and digital logic.

Technocracy emerged in the 1930s as Scientists and Engineers proposed a better
and brighter way forward, paved by the relentless application of technology to
the problems of modern society.

The realm of computers is currently a very secular one, albeit tainted at the
fringes with brain-bending notions of equal understanding, co-operation, and
productivity no matter how little the people present know about the subject
matter, or comprehension of the subtleties of the project's goals.

All of the best programmers that I know, while potentially having fringe
political opinions, will co-operate happily with just about everybody under the
sun as long as they share the core programmers' motivation of making magic
within the machine. I personally have a great antipathy for any sort of moral
posturing that positions groups of people as greater or lesser out on the field.
The only thing that should matter when programming is the collective
accomplishment of the goals of the project.

One of my colleagues has a particularly interesting Twitter account, with views
that, if we were to speak about them, I would vehemently disagree with, and
attempt to persuade him otherwise. His work and feedback on my work are so
useful that I dare not disrupt our excellent working relationship by doing this.

While programming, we must keep God's moral principles in our hearts, or we risk
losing our humanity to daemons of our own creation.
