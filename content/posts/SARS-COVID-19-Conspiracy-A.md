# Introduction 

With everybody stuck indoors with plenty of time to think, the internet is
abuzz with conversation and speculation. The topic that the mainstream can't
seem to stop talking about, despite a banking crisis and the global trial of new
communication technology, is the **coronavirus**. Some of this conversation
revolves around connecting far-flung dots together in creative ways, and I
relish the opportunity to observe and participate in these thought experiments.

Do note that this article is, in part, a work of **fiction**; some claims made are
unsubstantiated or considered hilarious by the scientific community.

As I write this, on **March 21st, 2020**, the City of Ottawa is quiet.

# Argument

In a single thought, the Coronavirus is a psyop[^psyop] to bring in the NWO[^nwo].

- Coronavirus is part of WHO/UN Agendas 21[^un-21] and 30[^un-30].
- Viral symptoms are caused by 5G and pollution.
- Small businesses will be destroyed via months-long quarantine.
- Vaccine administration will be used to implement a Universal Identification
  system to monitor the citizens of every country[^id2020].
- The virus doesn't actually exist.

**Wow.** I'll do my best to substantiate as many of these points as I can with
real science. Afterwards, I'll break down the inconsistencies.

## The Puzzle Pieces

### Military Use of Millimeter-Wave Bombardments

Militaries are currently in a race to develop *directed energy weapons* or
*DEWs*, to counteract a wide variety of situations, from crowd dispersal
(*Active Denial Systems*[^ads] like *V-MADS*[^vmads],) to particle beams, plasma
weapons like *MARAUDER*, and laser weapons.

*Raytheon* and the *U.S. Air Force* are currently developing an *ADS*,
essentially a microwave beam designed to superheat the skin of humans, momentarily
causing excruciating pain. The system can also destroy unshielded electronics.

*ADS* functions by firing a beam of **95 GHz** electromagnetic waves at a
target. At this frequency, the EMF wavelength is **3.2 mm**, and will be
absorbed into the first **0.4 mm** of human tissue, which allows the weapon to
avoid nerve endings and blood vessels, unless used against babies[^ads-baby].

Compared to microwave ovens, which use a **2.45 GHz** frequency and penetrate
**17 mm** into human tissue, the *ADS* is far safer to direct at a human because
it will only impact the dermis.

*Raytheon* released a smaller version of the ADS, which has a similar beam with
a power dissipation of 30 kW. The effects are best described by the *US-DoD
Non-Letal Weapons Program*[^dod-nlw]:

> Adverse reactions are extremely rare, temporary and consist of skin blisters. Exposure to the Active Denial System can also result in a temporary reddening of the skin. Research shows there is only a 1/10th of 1% chance of injury from Active Denial System exposure. Normal, innate, self-protect behaviors such as eye blink, head turn and aversion response all minimize the risk of injury. The energy reaches a skin depth of only about 1/64th of an inch, the equivalent of three sheets of paper. The sensation immediately ceases when the individual moves out of the beam.

### Wuhan's Mandatory Vaccination Program

### We Cannot Prove Viruses are Real 

- Dr. Stefan Lanka

*Greppendemia und Tamiflu*[^history-infection-theory]

### Masonic Symbolism



## Connecting the Dots

## Conclusions

The virus is fake, and the side effects are due to 5G cellular radiation enabling
human cellular Electroporation, inhibiting oxygen uptake and causing the 'viral'
symptoms by allowing viral matter from vaccines (and polluted water supplies)
into human cells.  Ultimately, the goal is to communize the globe through the
destruction of private enterprise, while also forcing universal digital
identification[^id2020] and moving the globe closer to a centrally-controlled
Masonic Utopia.
