<br />

Exhausted. At the end of our day, Gen Z all end up drained, even if we don't do much.

Certainly, part of my personal issue was my attatchment to *the new drug*, digital media.

It takes a fierce grip, tempting the mind with an open firehose of facts and events, keeping us hooked on *knowing*. Like an alcoholic or heroin addict, becoming absorbed in the *now* of the world takes you out of your personal *now*. It estranges us from our roommates, families, communities, religions, and *the good*.

The new drug is endless, shallow infotainment.

...

I've done my best to design my life, and this new site, to address this issue.

While I *could* go through the effort to implement sharing buttons, google analytics, forms, facebook chatbot integrations, complex menu systems, and the like, I've done that before. For a time, inserting and tweaking these things are fun. After a long time, though, they become a chore. You feel the need to stay up to date and implement the latest and greatest every time it rolls around.

I've been planning to do a minimal re-write for a while, and here it is! No sharing buttons, menus, tracking, Facebook or Google, and above all, *no JavaScript!*

Don't get me wrong, I *love* JavaScript. At a point, though, shoveling JavaScript at a user becomes an ethical issue for any programmer who cares about those in the developing world, operating on low-perf devices.

...

Our senses are overburdened with digital events to process; I feel it is better to have fewer, and so, I have designed my site to address the issue. Not intentionally, really; I just wrote a paginator in *Hugo* and liked it so much I decided that my entire site would just be one paginator.

Lately I've been feeling that, like many others in my discipline, I've caught a rather horrible case of keeping up with the joneses. For the longest time, I stressed about how I would assemble my new personal site, asking questions like:

- Which static site generator? Hugo? Gatsby?
- Which CSS framework? Bootstrap? Pure? Bulma?
- Should I write it using Flask, Django, RoR so I can track users, run fun experiments, and host endpoints for APIs and Chatbots?

Then I asked myself: **Why do I want a personal site?**

My answer was, really: to store a repository of notes and texts, primarily for personal use (but publicly accessible,) and with the ability to share a fast-loading, minimalistic view for others.

And so, I've gone and done it. I've stripped out everything I didn't need: slow-loading JavaScript, fonts, assets, and complex css. The colors and fonts are chosen to be easy on the eyes, and so I don't have to worry about how fonts will appear. Everything about the design is here to eliminate my need to endlessly tinker and tweak, allowing me to focus on what I deem is truly valuable:

- Writing about things I enjoy.
- Writing about things that are important.
- Writing about technology that I use.

And so, this site is to be a rolling-release blog packed to the gills with personal notes, articles, etc. I hope you find my public repository of knowledge useful.
